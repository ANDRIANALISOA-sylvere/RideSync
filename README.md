# RideSync

> Real-time ride dispatch system , connecting riders and drivers instantly.

RideSync is a microservices-based backend system that handles ride requests, driver matching, and real-time location tracking. Built to explore distributed systems, event-driven architecture, and CQRS in a real-world context.

---

## The Problem

In many cities, dispatch systems are either non-existent or centralized in a single fragile server:

- No real-time visibility on driver locations
- Manual matching between riders and drivers
- No audit trail of rides
- A single crash takes down the entire system

**RideSync solves this with a distributed, event-driven architecture.**

---

## How It Works

```
1. Driver comes online       → sends location every 5s
2. Rider requests a ride     → POST /rides/request
3. System finds nearest driver → Redis Geosearch (within 3km)
4. Driver gets notified      → WebSocket
5. Driver accepts            → RideAccepted event emitted
6. Rider sees driver move    → WebSocket real-time tracking
7. Ride completes            → RideCompleted event emitted
8. Both get notified         → NotificationService
```

### What happens if driver cancels?

```
DriverCancelled event
  → Saga compensation kicks in
  → Rider is re-matched with next available driver
  → Or ride is cancelled with notification
```

## Services

| Service                | Port | Responsibility                    |
| ---------------------- | ---- | --------------------------------- |
| `api-gateway`          | 3000 | Single entry point, routing, auth |
| `location-service`     | 3001 | Driver positions, Redis Geosearch |
| `ride-service`         | 3002 | Ride lifecycle, matching, Saga    |
| `notification-service` | 3003 | WebSocket, push notifications     |

---

## Events Flow (RabbitMQ)

```
LocationUpdated       → ride-service updates nearby drivers
RideRequested         → location-service finds nearest driver
DriverMatched         → notification-service notifies driver
RideAccepted          → notification-service notifies rider
RideCompleted         → notification-service notifies both
DriverCancelled       → ride-service triggers re-matching
```

## API Endpoints

### Auth (via API Gateway)

```bash
POST /auth/register    # Register as rider or driver
POST /auth/login       # Login → JWT token
```

### Rides

```bash
POST /rides/request              # Rider requests a ride
GET  /rides/:id                  # Get ride status
POST /rides/:id/accept           # Driver accepts
POST /rides/:id/cancel           # Driver or rider cancels
POST /rides/:id/complete         # Driver completes ride
GET  /rides/history              # Ride history
```

### Location

```bash
POST /location/update            # Driver sends position
GET  /location/drivers/nearby    # Rider sees nearby drivers
```

### WebSocket Events

```bash
# Connect
ws://localhost:3000?token=<jwt>

# Listen
ride:matched          → driver found for your request
ride:driver-location  → driver position update (real-time)
ride:accepted         → driver accepted your ride
ride:completed        → ride is done
ride:cancelled        → ride was cancelled

# Emit
location:update       → driver sends { lat, lng }
```

## CQRS in Action

```
COMMAND side (writes)           QUERY side (reads)
─────────────────────           ──────────────────
POST /rides/request             GET /rides/:id
POST /location/update           GET /location/drivers/nearby
POST /rides/:id/accept          GET /rides/history

Writes → PostgreSQL (source of truth)
Reads  → Redis cache (fast, scalable)
```

---

## Saga Pattern — Ride Cancellation

```
Happy path:
  RideRequested → DriverMatched → RideAccepted → RideCompleted

Compensation (driver cancels):
  DriverCancelled
    → Mark ride as "searching again"
    → Find next available driver
    → Notify rider: "Finding another driver..."
    → If no driver found in 2 min → RideCancelled
```

---

## Concepts Applied

- **Microservices** — each service is independent, deployable separately
- **CQRS** — separate read and write models
- **Event-Driven Architecture** — services communicate via RabbitMQ events
- **Saga Pattern** — distributed transaction compensation
- **Redis Geosearch** — find drivers within X km radius
- **WebSockets** — real-time location updates
- **Docker Compose** — orchestrate all services locally
